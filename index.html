                       I am a senior at San Jose State University and will be graduating in December 2017 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I find Computer Science interesting because it is a field that is constantly changing and developing. As a student, I focused on developing skills in various areas of Computer Science. My Computer Science classes have created a foundation that has allowed me to excel in the real world. My first internship at Make School was mainly focused on developing an iOS application for children to improve their vocabulary. My second internship was at a startup called Expert Seats. At Expert Seats, I worked on front-end web development and automation tool for reporting user data. Lastly, I was employed at Western Digital as a Big Data Intern. At Western Digital, I was pushed outside my comfort zone and was able to successfully work on a machine learning POC using various technologies such as Spark, Hive, and Hadoop. My experience shows a wide variety of skillset, however, it also showcases my ability to pick up new roles fairly quickly. I am always looking for opportunities that will allow me to enhance my current skillset and learn new technologies.

                    As a Big Data Engineering Intern at Western Digital, I worked on a POC using the Spark Machine Learning (ML) library. Initially, I had very minimal experience in this area. However, I went put through put through hands on training on mahine learning with spark. This training provided by a team at Cloudera. After the training, I was able to differetiate the uses of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The objective of the POC was to be able to find error patterns within the manufacturing data. These patterns will allow manufacturing facitilies to prevent errors within the manufacturing process. I used multiple different supervised alogrithms within the Spark library. Along with Spark, I was able to gain experience with other technologies such as Hive, Impala, and SPSS Modeler.
                    <!--Besides, Spark ML POC, I created a One Time Secret Instance and a URL Shortener web application to allow for easy and secure sharing for others within the company.
                    I have also gained exposure to database technologies such as Redis, Hive, Impala and Hadoop, and used Jenkins, Maven, and Ansible, to deploy completed projects.-->

                    As a a Intern, I worked on a web based project. I contributed to both the frontend and backend aspect of the project. My main accomplishment during this project was being able to improve the loading speed of the consumer website by utilizing parallel and resuable code. I also integrated Smarty (PHP based template) to automate common changes throughout the website. Next, I worked on improving the website design by analyzing user data from Google Analytics. I mainly focused on finding patterns based on the footprints left behind by user's while using the website. Finally,I worked on improving data retrieval from the database by parallelizing the work amongst multiple nodes. Through this internship, I gained valuable experience in web development and the importance of automating various tasks.

                   As a iOS Developer Intern at Make School, I worked on a new application which was directed towards education for students. It was an application to improve vocabulary for various standardized exams by challenging friends. I worked on several features, however, my main focus was allowing the application to support multiplayer use. I made my code modular to support multiple players based on user preference. Additionally, I learned how to participate and constibute to a codebase through usage of version control and proper documentation.

The environment consisted of a MySQL database with JDBC connector. The challenging part about this project was creating a Schema with proper constraints. I wanted to create a databse that was BCNF complient. I also added some features that would enable the user to add and delete books within the database.

                           This class project exposed me to various big data technologies used for processing large amounts of data. For this project, we used a dataset provided by Yelp. Initially, we wrote some basic queries using mySQL. However, the amount of time it took the process the data was efficient. Therefore, we decided to explore other technologies supported on Hortonworks. We used Virtual Box to load an image of Hortonworks and uploaded all the necessary data to Ambari. Next, we used Hive and Hadoop to improve processing time. We compared and analyzed the use of different technologies based on the type of query.
